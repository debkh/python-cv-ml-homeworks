# 🎓 Python Computer Vision & ML Homework

Welcome to my playground for the Python Computer Vision and Machine Learning course. 📚 Each lesson lives in this repo so I can experiment, take notes, and keep track of homework progress.

## 📁 Project Layout

- `data/lesson_1/` – raw assets used inside the notebooks.
- `notebooks/lesson_1/main.ipynb` – primary notebook for lesson one explorations.
- `src/` – lightweight scripts (e.g., `main.py`) for quick experiments or utilities.
- `requirements.txt` – pinned dependencies for the course assignments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment (conda or `python -m venv .venv`).
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook inside the `notebooks/lesson_1/` folder to walk through the exercises.

## 🥅 Goals

- Practice OpenCV image manipulations and visualization.
- Build intuition for computer-vision preprocessing pipelines.
- Document takeaways from each lesson as I go.
